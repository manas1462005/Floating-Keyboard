# Floating-Keyboard
Air Typing Gesture Keyboard is a Python-based virtual keyboard that lets you type using hand gestures captured via a webcam. It uses real-time hand tracking to detect fingertip positions, highlights keys when hovered, and allows selection through a simple press or hover mechanism, all without touching a physical keyboard.
